### Break Through Tech AI Studio Project (2025)  
**In collaboration with CariCon**

UCSC • UCSD • UCR • CSULB • SJSU

---

## ⭐ Project Highlights
- Built an end-to-end machine learning system to match Caribbean authors with publishers, literary agents, and producers  
- Integrated **800+ historical book-to-production adaptation records** across multiple datasets  
- Achieved strong supervised performance with **~96% accuracy** and **ROC-AUC ≈ 0.99**  
- Applied unsupervised topic modeling to uncover interpretable narrative and genre clusters  
- Designed a scalable recommendation framework aligned with real-world creative industry needs  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
CariConnect is an AI-powered recommendation system designed to improve visibility and representation for Caribbean authors by matching them with relevant publishers, literary agents, and producers.

Caribbean creatives often face barriers to exposure and access within traditional publishing and production pipelines. CariConnect addresses this challenge by leveraging machine learning to analyze historical adaptation patterns, genre alignment, narrative themes, and creative metadata to predict author–producer compatibility.

This project was developed as part of the **Break Through Tech AI Studio** program in collaboration with **CariCon**, an organization dedicated to expanding Caribbean literature, culture, and storytelling on a global scale.

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Build an end-to-end ML system for author–producer matching  
- Clean, merge, and standardize multi-source datasets  
- Engineer features from both textual and categorical data  
- Train supervised and unsupervised models to assess match likelihood  
- Evaluate model performance using Accuracy, ROC-AUC, Precision, Recall, and F1  
- Provide interpretable clustering to help authors identify creative “neighborhoods”

## 📚 Data Exploration

### Datasets Used
- **Book-to-Production Adaptation Records**  
  - 831+ entries documenting historical adaptations  
- **Author Metadata**  
  - Genre labels, descriptions, and writing attributes  
- **Literary Agent Dataset**  
  - Agent roles, affiliations, and representation data  

### Data Preprocessing & Assumptions
- Removed duplicate records and standardized genre labels  
- Cleaned missing or inconsistent metadata fields  
- Normalized textual inputs for downstream modeling  
- Assumed historical adaptation trends provide signal for future compatibility

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis & Topic Modeling

### KMeans Clustering Results
![KMeans Cluster Distribution](images/kmeans_cluster_distribution.png)

We observed a highly imbalanced cluster distribution, with one dominant cluster containing over 200 books.  
This suggests that KMeans may group certain dominant themes too aggressively.

### LDA Topic Modeling Results
![LDA Topic Distribution](images/lda_topic_distribution.png)

LDA produced a more balanced topic distribution, indicating improved separation of narrative themes.

## 📈 Model Evaluation Results
![Confusion Matrix Results](images/confusion_matrix_results.png)

The supervised model achieved strong performance across evaluation metrics, demonstrating effective author–producer compatibility prediction.

**Key Insights**
- Certain genres (e.g., drama, folklore, historical fiction) appear disproportionately adapted  
- Topic modeling reveals coherent narrative clusters aligned with adaptation likelihood  
- These insights informed feature selection and overall model design

## 🧠 Model Development

### Methods & Justification
- **Supervised Learning**  
  - Random Forest classifier selected for robustness to mixed feature types and interpretability  
- **Unsupervised Learning**  
  - TF-IDF + KMeans, LDA, and BERTopic explored to uncover latent thematic structures  

Unsupervised topic modeling provided interpretable creative clusters that helped explain historical adaptation trends and guided downstream supervised feature engineering.

### Technical Architecture
1. Data ingestion and preprocessing  
2. Feature engineering (textual + categorical)  
3. Unsupervised topic modeling and clustering  
4. Supervised classification and evaluation  
5. Result interpretation and documentation

## 📈 Results & Key Findings

### Supervised Model Performance
- **Accuracy:** ~96%  
- **ROC-AUC:** ≈ 0.99  

### Unsupervised Outcomes
- Coherent topic clusters aligned with genre and narrative themes  
- Improved interpretability of author–producer relationships  
- Provided qualitative insights beyond numeric prediction scores
